For a few things to go over with this is do have some ideas,
one thing thats this page can do at the very top of it is that it
can explain how D&D works (in basic terms) then  
kind of go threw what each of the pages are going to explain (in decimal format)

5/1/24 notes

for the moble menu i have to change the image size to a min and max size
for the character sheet this is going to be the easiest one its just a bit of typeing, i should also include a video so the end user doesnt have to read it all
for the dice page i need to work on the jquery to make the slide show to make it look less wordy

after this i should be done with most of the webside
