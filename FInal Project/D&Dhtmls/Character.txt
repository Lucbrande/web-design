This is the pure basics of a chararcter sheet for more indepth use you can use the websice 5e.tools for fether explanation

for the video link i am just going to find someone explaining how to do a chararcter sheet so that the end user doesnt have to read it all



1 race a race is the 
subrace
class
background

1 What is a subrace? when yor first create the character you will have a main race and subrace, example orc and half orc
2 what is a class? it tells you what you are able to do, meaning what area of attack you want to go into
3 what is a background, this is the story of your character, it doesnt need to be really long but make sure there is a little depth inside it

2 ability scores
roll method this will refrance the dice page for its use
2 of the possible skills
picking your arc type
disiding your hitpoints

1 what is a roll method roll all your dice at once, what ever the added number is you put into one of the categroys 
2 you can only add on 2 posbble skills unless the dm gives you specific instruction to do more
3 what is your arc type this is based on your subclass which is basily picking another class

3 deciding starting equipment
this is based off of your started class and abilitys
there are 4 major weapon catigorys that can follow with your class
